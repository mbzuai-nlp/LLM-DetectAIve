## Overview  

LLM-DetectAIve is a system designed for fine-grained MGT detection. It is aims to classify texts from a variety of topics into four categories: human-written, machine-generated, machine-written machine-humanized, and human-written machine-polished.

LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the authorship of textual content, proving its usefulness in enhancing integrity in education, academia, and other domains. LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible on hugging face

## Demo Interface

The demonstration for LLM-DetectAIve has two tabs

### 1. Automatic Text Detection
![Demo Interface 2](assets/Interface1.png)

    
Lets the user input any text (> 50 words) to get a prediction from LLM-DetectAIve.


### 2. Human Detector Playground

![Demo Interface 2](assets/Interface2.png)

Lets the user see if they can correctly label data given a random sample text.

## Data Generated

Across LLMs over the four classes:  
I. Human-Written  
II. Machine-Generated  
III. Machine-Written Machine-Humanized  
IV. Human-Written Machine-Polished

<!-- <img src="assets\data_generated_table.png" width="100%"> -->
For row II + III + IV, the data is approximately uniformly distributed across the three classes.

    abstract = "The ease of access to large language models (LLMs) has enabled a widespread of machine-generated texts, and now it is often hard to tell whether a piece of text was human-written or machine-generated. This raises concerns about potential misuse, particularly within educational and academic domains. Thus, it is important to develop practical systems that can automate the process. Here, we present one such system, LLM-DetectAIve, designed for fine-grained detection. Unlike most previous work on machine-generated text detection, which focused on binary classification, LLM-DetectAIve supports four categories: (i) human-written, (ii) machine-generated, (iii) machine-written, then machine-humanized, and (iv) human-written, then machine-polished. Category (iii) aims to detect attempts to obfuscate the fact that a text was machine-generated, while category (iv) looks for cases where the LLM was used to polish a human-written text, which is typically acceptable in academic writing, but not in education. Our experiments show that LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the above four categories, which makes it a potentially useful tool in education, academia, and other domains.LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/LLM-DetectAIve.
