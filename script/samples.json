        "Reading ones emotions using technologydoesn sound os bad but it also sounds just as badas it seems to be good technology for someone to have for family use, Mona Lisa was used for this experimet, and showed happiness, and some other objecrs and mostly was happiness, resultingin a somewhat successful attempt at technology.. Im siding for this as it can reveal a persons inner emotions and see if they are suffering on the inside out. Besides, its not everydy you can judge emotion by the face only right? it would only help us more in the end then hurt us in the long run. But of course the cost of the product would be a quite big infact, maybe to big for distribution, whichcan lead to problems later on. Sure, using your mouth muscles revealing emotions is easy, but it can be a bit hard for those with stage fright or insocial status to show emotions around strangers, thats why this inventions is a great thing to me to know and have in the world of mysteries.

        "People should agree that the face on Mars was probably an accident. The face probably was not a face, it could have been another Martian mesa. A rock os some type could have hit it or a meteor could also. Next, NASA took pictures of it, and NASA was researching it and studying it, so they can get more information on it. After studying it, they took a picture of it, and they engaged the public with it. People started to have debates about the picture and what it could have ment. \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence pof life on Mars.\" The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh NASA said it was a \"huge rock information\" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it. You got to study the artifact before you can assume it is from aliens. After that, you got to be able to back up your answer , and saying why it is not a face. \"Thousands of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform.\" People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars. In conclusion, the artifact could have just been hit by a rock. People need to belive most things that are not really true. ",

Driverless cars could change the transportation. It would make it easier to go place to place. Driverless cars could prevent accidents from occurring in everyday traffic. These cars would be much safer than a car with a reckless driver. Millions of car accidents happen every year, but driverless cars could potentially prevent most of these accidents. With a driverless car, the passengers are safer because the car is programmed to work well. If there was an emergency, someone could take the wheel and have control of the car. Driverless cars have great potential for public transportation. Driverless cars could act like a taxi or bus system. This system of driverless cars would safe people money by not owning their own car. It would be safer to have many of these cars. Millions are killed in drunk driving accidents, and these cars would give potential drunk drivers an alternative way to get home safely. These cars could be used in a public transportation system to help people travel in their every day lives. Driverless cars are approaching quickly, and there must be decisions made on their involvement of people's lives. These cars would be safer than reckless drivers on the road.

        "As time progresses, technology becomes even more of an evident and essential apart of our everyday lives. Society is moving toward an almost completely digital lifestyles, causing the youth to become even more involved in phones, computers, and etc. Although this ongoing innovation is an improvement, it also has made its case as a potential hazard to today's generation. Specifically, when combining the machinery of vehicles, which are capable of killing passengers at personality of cellphones, the result is fatal disaster Basically, while cellphones are helpful technology, drivers should rarely or never use them when operating any vehicle. Primarily, as the number of people using cell phones while driving will also increase on streets and highways. At the same time rate, drivers still talk on cell phones and send text messages while driving. They will also engaging in other activities apart from driving. For example, drives will text when driving, and they will dial numbers. Drivers will also receive calls and talk on their devices for long periods of time. Again, driving demands your full attention, and your concentration which is taken away when talking on the phone it means that the driver has to divert his attention to the conversation, which leads to less concentration on the road. All in all, one can connect accidents and cell phone usage while driving to this very diversion of attention.\n Furthermore, drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Ad a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

        "Imagine a lost, confused version of yourself. Perhaps it's an essay, a project, or a personal situation that has you conflicted. You have no idea what to do or what to think of. You are stuck. The first thing that pops into your head is to consult your peers, but not just one. Asking for advice from more than one person has many upsides. You can see what others think of your situation, there can be many different thoughts. Someone may suggest a better idea to you than others, it is always beneficial for you to consider a different perspective. There could be multiple ideas that you didn't even think of before. For example, if you had a ton of homework, there are many different things that people could suggest. Do the hardest things first, do the easiest things first, or just wait until the next day to complete it all. They all have different opinions, but you can get it all from just asking multiple people for advice. Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest. Consulting others for advice can help you do that. Perhaps your situation isn't as horrible as you thought, maybe it could be easily fixed and dealt with. People other than yourself can help you see the good things in bad situations. You could have this sense of relief from just consulting someone for their opinion. Simple as that! Asking more than one person for advice is critical. You can see what others think, receive many different opinions that are better than the others, and view your dilemma in a new perspective. After all of that, your situation could seem easier to understand and not so terrible as you thought. Asking just one person for their thoughts is a mistake, do not forget to ask another! ",

If you let the students have their phones out during lunch and free time it would be beneficial in many ways.\n For one, if you decided to go with policy 2, you would most likely find a lot of students getting caught with cell phones. Taking away the cell phone privilege from students is bad and good in a way. Its bad because students wouldn't be able to communicate with their parents very well, so they would end up trying to hide it from the teacher, and getting caught in class and during passing time. It would be good because teachers would spend less time taking phones away, but actually teaching the class instead.\n Students do need phone time. Their parents might be trying to get a hold of them for an emergency, so if no phones are aloud, the student would never be able to return that call or text. If phones were aloud, that student would be able to communicate and return that missed call to that parents emergency or needs. Having a no cell phone at all policy would lead to many phones getting taken away and many other problems involving a phone. If I were the principal, I would go with policy 1.

The harsh environment on Venus, with its crushing pressure and scorching temperatures, poses significant technical hurdles for the vehicle's design and operation. Moreover, the corrosive atmosphere and sulfuric acid droplets in the air add to the complexity of the mission. The vehicle's material selection, insulation, and navigation systems must be carefully designed to withstand these extreme conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the communication with the vehicle will be a major challenge due to the dense atmosphere on Venus, which makes signal transmission difficult. The risk of data loss and communication breakdowns is high, which could compromise the entire mission. Additionally, the psychological toll on the ground crew and the astronauts involved in the mission cannot be underestimated. The stress of navigating such a high-risk mission could take a significant mental health toll.\n\nDespite these challenges, I firmly believe that the investment of time, money, and human lives is worth it. The potential rewards of exploring Venus, often referred to as Earth's \"sister planet,\" far outweigh the risks. Venus holds many secrets about the early formation of our solar system and the potential for life beyond Earth. Uncovering these secrets could have groundbreaking implications for our understanding of the universe and our place within it.\n\nMoreover, the technological advancements that will arise from this mission will have far-reaching benefits for future space exploration. The development of materials and systems that can withstand extreme environments will have applications in various fields, from aerospace to medicine.\n\nIn conclusion, while NASA's plan to explore Venus using a blimp-like vehicle comes with significant challenges and risks, the potential rewards make it a worthwhile investment.

While the intention behind this policy is to motivate students to focus on their academic performance, it ultimately ignores the diverse needs and motivations of students.\n\nOn one hand, this policy might encourage some students to work harder and improve their grades.

Furthermore, this policy neglects the fact that extracurricular activities can be a vital outlet for students to develop valuable social skills, build confidence, and relieve stress \u2013 all of which are essential for overall well-being.\n\nMoreover, this policy may disproportionately affect students from disadvantaged backgrounds who may already face additional barriers to academic success.

As evidenced by the proposed \"blimp-like vehicle,\" the necessary altitude and temperature for operation, and the development of innovative technology for exploration, it is clear that the benefits of studying Venus far outweigh the risks.\n\nThe author's perspective is that Venus, although hostile to human exploration, holds valuable secrets that could significantly advance our understanding of the universe. The extreme environment of Venus, with temperatures reaching up to 462\u00b0C and crushing pressure, presents a unique opportunity for scientists to develop innovative technologies that can withstand such conditions. The proposed \"blimp-like vehicle\" is a testament to human ingenuity, as it would need to operate at an altitude of 50-60 km above the Venusian surface, where the temperature and pressure are relatively tolerable.\n\nThe development of such technology would not only facilitate the exploration of Venus but also have far-reaching implications for future space missions. Moreover, studying Venus could provide valuable insights into the planet's unique atmosphere and geological processes, which could shed light on the Earth's own climate and evolution.

For instance, a student who wants to learn a new instrument may not have the time to take lessons. Furthermore, students already have numerous responsibilities, such as taking care of a sibling, focusing on education, and completing household chores. Adding community service to their plate may be overwhelming and potentially detrimental to their mental health. Without sufficient free time, students may not be able to socialize with friends, spend quality time with family, or simply enjoy their childhood. This could lead to unhappiness and depression at a young age, creating unfavorable memories of their childhood. I believe that students should be allowed to enjoy their childhood without the burden of mandatory community service, which can be overly demanding and restrictive.",

        "Owning a vehicle or license is not what it used to be. Across the globe, people are abandoning driving in favor of alternative modes of transportation, which offer numerous benefits, including reduced pollution, cost-effectiveness, and improved well-being. There are a surprising number of options available for those who do not want to drive a car. In many major cities, especially in America and Europe, public transportation such as trains and buses is readily available. For instance, San Francisco, a bustling city with many young residents, has seen a decline in the number of people interested in obtaining their licenses. Many residents organize their summer jobs and social life around public transportation, carpooling, or walking, making car ownership unnecessary. Similarly, some cities, like Vauban in Germany, have been specifically designed to be navigated on foot. These towns are tailored to meet the needs of their residents, with stores conveniently located within walking distance, eliminating the need for driving. By abandoning cars, people can make a significant impact on reducing air pollution. In Paris, the capital of France, a driving ban was implemented due to severe smog, resulting in a 60% decrease in congestion. Residents like Heidrun Walter have also reported improved happiness, stating, 'When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'",

        "Following extensive research, I have come to the conclusion that the electoral college should be abolished. The current system is not completely fair, as citizens are misled into believing they are voting directly for their preferred candidate, when, in reality, they are voting for that candidate's electors. This means that even if a candidate wins the popular vote, they may not necessarily win the electoral college votes. Consequently, the president elected may not be the candidate that the majority of U.S. citizens prefer. According to the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College,\" the question of whether voters can control whom their electors vote for is met with a resounding \"not always.\" This highlights the inherent unfairness of the electoral college system. Furthermore, some electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast their vote for someone else, as stated in \"The Indefensible Electoral College.\" \n\n\"Over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election, which is more than half of the U.S. population,\" according to \"The Indefensible Electoral College.\" I believe that, along with this majority, we should abolish the electoral college, ensuring that the president of the United States is elected through a fair and direct process. Some may argue that the electoral college is necessary in the event of a tie, but this has only occurred once, rendering it unnecessary. Other arguments in favor of the electoral college, such as providing certainty of an outcome, benefiting large states, and avoiding runoff elections, are also not compelling enough to justify its retention. In conclusion, I, along with 60 percent of the U.S. population, firmly believe that the electoral college should be abolished due to its inherent unfairness.",

For instance, understanding why Venus is called the \"Evening Star\" when it is actually a planet. Although Venus is a challenging place to examine, it is a worthy pursuit. \n\nOne of the significant dangers of studying Venus is its extreme environment. With temperatures averaging over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that of Earth, making the conditions far more extreme than anything we encounter on our planet. Additionally, Venus experiences erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Despite these dangers, Venus remains an attractive option for exploration due to its similarities to Earth. In fact, Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, having once been covered in oceans that could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus features rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. \n\nTo overcome the challenges, NASA has proposed a solution: a blimp-like vehicle that hovers 30 miles above the Venusian landscape, similar to an airplane flying above storms. At this altitude, solar power would be abundant, and radiation levels would be survivable, although not easy. Despite the risks, the value of studying Venus lies in its potential to prepare us for the possibility of relocating to another planet. Human curiosity will undoubtedly drive us to undertake intimidating endeavors, and exploring Venus is a crucial step in this direction. While studying Venus is dangerous, it also has its benefits.",

        "Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally even distance. Although we sometimes find ourselves closer to Mars, Venus remains a crucial subject of study. Notably, each previous mission to Venus was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft had survived the landing for more than a few hours. In fact, no single spaceship has successfully touched down on Venus in more than three decades. This is largely due to the planet's thick atmosphere, composed of almost 97% carbon dioxide. The surface temperature on Venus exceeds 800 degrees, which is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. These extreme conditions on Venus are unparalleled, even surpassing those experienced by submarines diving into the deepest parts of our oceans. The heat is so intense that it would liquify metals. Despite Mercury being closer to the sun, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Furthermore, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments, including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes, making it a significant challenge for probes seeking to land on its surface. \n\nVenus likely had oceans and could have supported various forms of life, similar to Earth, and still exhibits features like rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. However, given the long time frames of space travel, these similarities must be considered in the context of exploration. One potential solution is to design a vehicle that can hover above Venus, avoiding the unfriendly ground conditions by staying at an altitude of over 30 miles above the surface. Although the temperature would still be hot, around 170 degrees, the air pressure would be similar to sea level on Earth, and radiation levels would not exceed those on Earth. Therefore, the conditions on Venus could be survivable for humans. However, most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Ultimately, our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance, making in-situ exploration essential for a deeper understanding of Venus.",

While there are potential drawbacks to consider, the benefits of seeking multiple perspectives are numerous. By asking for advice, we can expose ourselves to alternative viewpoints that might have been overlooked, and others can catch mistakes that we or a single advisor may have missed. Furthermore, seeking advice shows that we value clarity and are willing to consider others' ideas, which can help us refine our thoughts and decisions. Moreover, seeking multiple opinions can help us understand different viewpoints, revise our decisions, and avoid irrational choices. Even if one person provides poor advice, seeking multiple opinions can help mitigate its negative impact. In fact, seeking advice can be likened to a process of iterative refinement, where each opinion serves as a revision that ultimately leads to a more polished outcome. Without seeking multiple opinions, we may miss crucial mistakes and misunderstandings, as we are often inclined to see what we want to see. Having multiple perspectives can help us identify and correct errors. While seeking advice can lead to stress and conflicting opinions, the benefits of gaining new insights and avoiding mistakes far outweigh the drawbacks.

        "The facial structure observed on Mars, dubbed the \"face on Mars,\" has sparked debate about its origin. While some believe it was created by aliens, I argue that it is a natural formation. In order to prove that it was constructed by extraterrestrial beings, we would need concrete evidence, which currently does not exist. After years of space exploration, we have not found any conclusive evidence of alien life or traces that can be unequivocally linked to extraterrestrial activity. It is unlikely that this structure was built by aliens.\n\nOn Earth, we have numerous natural formations, such as mesas and buttes, that resemble the face-like structure on Mars. These formations were created through geological processes, demonstrating that nature is capable of creating unique and intriguing landforms. Similarly, Mars, which shares some geological similarities with Earth, could have naturally formed this structure.\n\nWhile it is possible that aliens could have constructed the \"face on Mars,\" there is currently no empirical evidence to support this claim. The presence of water on Mars and its proximity to Earth make it a prime candidate for natural geological formations. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the \"face on Mars\" is a natural formation, rather than an alien construct. I have presented three key arguments: the lack of evidence for alien life, the existence of similar natural formations on Earth, and the rebuttal that, although possible, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that aliens built the structure.",

This freedom allows students to explore their resources and identify their strengths and weaknesses. I recall a fond memory from my 4th-grade year when my aunt would take my cousin, brother, and I to a frozen yogurt shop in Generic City. We would try all the flavors and toppings, making our own choices without being told what to do. Similarly, when I started playing Mortal Kombat 11, I was excited to try out new characters and their moves. However, I realized that I wasn't good with close-range fighters and excelled with characters that could attack from a distance. This experience taught me that allowing people to explore their limits can help them understand what they're good at and what they're not.\n\nJust like in Mortal Kombat, students need the freedom to discover their strengths and weaknesses without being constrained by strict rules.

        "As I reflect on the Electoral College system, I am convinced that it's time for the United States to transition to a popular vote system for electing its President. For over two centuries, the current system has fallen short of upholding the principles of democracy and representation. One of the most significant advantages of a popular vote system is that it places equal value on every citizen's vote. In contrast, the Electoral College system places undue emphasis on swing states, leaving many voters feeling overlooked and unheard. The fact that the winner of the popular vote has not always won the presidency is a stark reminder that the system is flawed. By adopting a popular vote system, the US can ensure that the President is truly the people's choice, rather than a select few. This change would be a crucial step towards strengthening democracy and giving every citizen a voice, regardless of where they call home.",

        "I strongly believe that the proposed policy change, requiring students to maintain a minimum grade of C to participate in extracurricular activities, is fundamentally flawed. While the intention is to motivate students to focus on their academic performance, it overlooks the unique needs and motivations of each student.\n\nOn the one hand, this policy might inspire some students to work harder and boost their grades. However, it's likely to dishearten students who are already struggling, leading to further disillusionment. Moreover, this policy dismisses the fact that extracurricular activities are a vital outlet for students to develop essential social skills, build confidence, and relieve stress \u2013 all crucial for their overall well-being.\n\nWhat's more, this policy may unfairly affect students from disadvantaged backgrounds who already face additional barriers to academic success. By denying them access to extracurricular activities, we risk exacerbating the gap between these students and their more privileged peers.\n\nUltimately, I firmly oppose this policy change, as it prioritizes academic achievement over student well-being and neglects the diverse needs of students. Instead, schools should focus on providing targeted support to students who need it, rather than punishing them for their academic struggles. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment that fosters the growth and success of all students.",

        "The privilege of driving is one that we all cherish, but it's also a privilege that's often abused. With the constant temptation of electronic devices, it's easier than ever to get distracted behind the wheel. But the risks are very real: in 2019, distracted driving claimed 3,600 lives and injured 391,000 people in the United States alone. Texting and driving, in particular, is a recipe for disaster - it takes your eyes off the road for 4.6 seconds on average, which is like driving the length of a football field at 55 miles per hour without looking up. And it's not just the driver who's at risk; passengers, pedestrians, and other road users are also in harm's way.\n\nThat's why I believe the Hands Free Law is a crucial step in the right direction. By banning the use of handheld phones and other devices while driving, we can remove the temptation to engage in distracting behaviors behind the wheel. I know some people might think this law is impractical or too restrictive, but I believe the benefits far outweigh the costs. By prioritizing road safety, we can prevent countless accidents, injuries, and fatalities.\n\nAs drivers, we have a responsibility to recognize the importance of driving responsibly. Losing our driving privileges is a serious consequence of reckless behavior behind the wheel, and it's up to us to understand the gravity of our actions. By choosing to drive responsibly, we can reduce the risk of accidents, protect ourselves and others, and maintain our privilege to drive. The Hands Free Law is a vital tool in promoting this culture of responsibility, and it's our collective duty to support and adhere to it. Only then can we ensure that our roads become safer, and the privilege of driving remains a right, not a deadly gamble. It's time for us to take responsibility for our actions behind the wheel and make our roads safer for everyone.",
